# fnext

A wip next.js replacement.  Currently probably isn't functional.

This was a project I made after getting annoyed waiting minutes for my next builds to complete.  Since then,
next.js has gotten faster (though is still quite slow) and is making strides to get rid of webpack, so this
project probably won't ever be completed - but it was a fun project so i've opted to make it public.
